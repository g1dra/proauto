                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rented vehicle is delivered and picked up or returned during the office’s opening hours
                        every day, Monday to Friday, from 8 a.m. till 8 p.m., and on Saturday and Sunday from 8 p.m.
                        till 1 p.m., or outside opening hours according to the official price list. The renter picks up
                        the vehicle with all the accompanying equipment and the vehicle’s documents, which the renter is
                        fully responsible for. In case of loss, theft or destruction, the renter is obliged to cover the
                        expenses of the manufacturing of new documents.
                        The renter is obliged to return the vehicle with all the accompanying equipment, tires and
                        tools, as stated in the check-out – check-in form.
                        The minimum duration of rent is one day or 24 hours. A grace period of 59 minutes is allowed
                        after the deadline for returning the vehicle. After this a day's charge will be made.
                        In case the renter fails to return the vehicle and does not extend the rental or does not notify
                        Pro Auto about the reasons for such a failure, Pro Auto has the right to appropriate the vehicle
                        from the renter. In such a case the renter is not eligeble to exercise his right of possession,
                        and compensation and possession rights.
                        The renter is obliged to notify Pro Auto of any damage or malfunctions that have occurred during
                        the renting of the vehicle. In the eventuality that Pro Auto finds out that certain parts of the
                        rented vehicle have been replaced, damaged or misappropriated, Pro Auto is entitled to a full
                        compensation of the cost of reestablishing the vehicle’s original condition. Additionally, the
                        renter will cover the entire shortfall due to Pro Auto’s not being able to rent out the car
                        during maintenance and/ or repairs.

                    <p>
                        During the duration of the rental contract, Pro Auto and the renter can agree upon an extension
                        of the rental contract. Such an extension is possible no later than 24 hours before the rental
                        expires.

                        vehicle is full when it is picked up and must also be returned with a full reservoir. In case
                        the reservoir is not full when the vehicle is returned, the renter will cover the cost of
                        refueling as well as of the additional fuel in accordance with the current price list.

                        Each renter is obliged to take very good care of the rented vehicle: they regularly check the
                        basic elements of the vehicle, the oil level in the engine, the coolant, the condition of the
                        battery, and the pressure in the tires. The renter is obliged to notify Pro Auto of any repairs
                        and/ or maintenance work within the duration of the rental and to carry out an appropriate
                        repair or service according to the company’s guidelines or instructions. In case the renter does
                        not acquire an approval for carrying out a car service or a repair, possible costs are not
                        acknowledged by Pro Auto. The renter is obliged to cover the costs arising from not respecting
                        this article of the rental contract.

                        not notify Pro Auto of malfunctions, the company does not recognize any cost claims on the side
                        of the renter.
